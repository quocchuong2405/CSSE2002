/**
 * The Receiver class represents a node in the fictional factory/machine that is responsible for
 * consuming or nullifying notes detected by its process. It nullifies the state of the node and
 * provides methods to interact with it. This class inherits the Tickable interface and ensures that
 * on each tick, the node in focus is nullified.
 * <p>
 * The Receiver class is designed to work in conjunction with the Producer node in the
 * factory/machine to achieve the desired production outcome.
 * <p>
 * It can be instantiated by providing the ID and Item (key) parameters, to provide parameters to
 * its inherited super class (Container).
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <p>
 * Receiver receiver = new Receiver(id, key);
 * <p>
 * Note that the setOutput and setInventory methods simply ensure that inherited methods of the same
 * name produce an error if called from the context of the receiver.
 * <p>
 * The getInventory method simply returns null, as the Receiver does not maintain an inventory.
