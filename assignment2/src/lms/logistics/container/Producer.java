/**
 * The Producer class represents a node in the fictional factory/machine that is responsible for
 * producing new items. This class inherits the Tickable interface and ensures that on each second
 * tick, a new item is created.
 * <p>
 * The Producer class is designed to work in conjunction with the Receiver node in the
 * factory/machine to achieve the desired production outcome.
 * <p>
 * It can be instantiated by providing the ID and Item (key) parameters, to provide parameters to
 * its inherited super class (Container).
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <p>
 * Producer producer = new Producer(id, key);
 * <p>
 * Note that the setInput and setInventory methods simply ensure that inherited methods of the same
 * name produce an error if called from the context of the Producer.
 * <p>
